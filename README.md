In this branch, I attempted to properly organize static files including CSS and JavaScript. I aimed to consolidate all CSS and JavaScript files into single files like style.css and app.js. However, the issue arose with the CSS files in the scss folder because I do not have bootstrap.css and other CSS files that are included in the theme I received. I paused my progress here because I believe it's best not to add files to the scss folder without consulting the frontend programmer first. In the main branch, I did not use Laravel Mix, and I added CSS links similar to how the frontend programmer implemented them in the theme.
